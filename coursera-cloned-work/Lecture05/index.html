<p>Just proved to myself that you need index.html file. I knew this, of course, however I didn't look it up, it just came to me and I managed to get this page up and running. So I am making this as a reminder on how to open up new pages/websites.</p>
<div>Firstly, open up a folder wherever you want the websites files to be on your local machine.</div>
<div>Secondly, clone your git repo(can create a new one) to said folder after navigating to in cmd</div>
<div>Once cloned, you can go ahead and enter your index.html(baseline) for your website into this folder</div>
<div>Run git status to see if it shows up as an untracked file.</div>
<div>Next is git add .(or file name/ . is simply 'all') to tell github that you would like to track this document.</div>
<div>Then git commin -m "(SLOT YOUR MESSAGE IN HERE, ITS GOOD PRACTICE TO ENSURE YOUR UPDATES ARE TRACKED)" to commit these files to your github repo. This is simply telling git that on your next push, it must upload these tracked files to github.</div>
<div>Finally, run a git push command to upload/push these tracked files to your repo. If someone else edits these and they have the permissions to do so, remember to run a git status to check if you are updated from github side. Run git pull if you are not updated.</div>
<div>I will probably laugh at myself for these simplified notes a year or two down the line when I am doing this as a part time job and making $$$ however I think it is important to keep track of the little achievements. This is simply that. A little achievement of understanding what exactly this git & github relationship is - and a demonstration of how to use div. I have not used span in this coding as nothing will be vaariable therefore I don't need it.</div>
